A simple plugin for Xcode to adjust font size without going into `Settings` → `Fonts & Colors` and changing each source type.

Simply hit `⌃ =` or `⌃ -` and all fonts will be adjusted. Plugin respects different font sizes per each syntax type.

**NOTE** keep in mind that it modifies the current theme file.

## Installation:

Install via [Alcatraz](https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz).

OR

Clone this repo, Build and restart Xcode.

## Troubleshooting

If you do not see the plugin menu anymore, most likely it means that you;ve updated Xcode and have an old version of the plugin. Simply re-install the plugin through Alcatraz or by cloning and building the repository.

If it didn't help, please open an issue.
